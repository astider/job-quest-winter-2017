![My Very First React App!](/job-quest.png)

I've done 2 out of 3 parts, Back-end and Front-end, because I still don't have knowledge in Data Analysis. I split codes into 3 directories. 
- ./node
- ./graphql
- ./react
using **yarn start** in each directory to start the process.

Back-end
---
I finished all APIs in the quest and setup MongoDB to test my code. The APIs server in running on localhost:8000 and MongoDB running on localhost:27017. All Todos and their states are saved in Database.

I also explore GraphQL and try to use it. Running on localhost:5000/graphql. Looks like it works, but I still have a lot to learn.

Front-end
---
I have near-zero Front-end experience, but I'm learning. So, I tried developing ReactJS follow the quest and plug it to GraphQL endpoint. Take a lot of time because a lot of errors occured. But finally works. I changed ReactJS rotating logo to mine and add some transition to the UI. It's runnong on port 3000.
